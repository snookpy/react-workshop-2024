```

## Start project

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website

```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with mycos example project, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/ or other port.
